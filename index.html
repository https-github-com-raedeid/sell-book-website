      <p data-aos="fade-left">Isobel is an artistic prodigy with a dangerous set of clients: the sinister fair folk,
        immortal creatures who
        cannot bake bread or put a pen to paper without crumbling to dust. They crave human Craft with a terrible
        thirst, and Isobel’s paintings are highly prized. But when she receives her first royal patron - Rook, the
        autumn prince - she makes a terrible mistake. She paints mortal sorrow in his eyes - a weakness that could cost
        him his life.</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up-right"> Furious, Rook spirits her away to his kingdom to stand trial for her crime. But
        something is seriously wrong
        in
        his world, and they are attacked from every side. With Isobel and Rook depending on each other for survival,
        their alliance blossoms into trust, then love - and that love violates the fair folks’ ruthless laws. Now both
        of their lives are forfeit, unless Isobel can use her skill as an artist to fight the fairy courts. Because
        secretly, her Craft represents a threat the fair folk have never faced in all the millennia of their unchanging
        lives: for the first time, her portraits have the power to make them feel.</p>

      <p id="tit" data-aos="zoom-in-right">MR. DICKENS AND HIS CAROL $8.89</p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left">Charles Dickens is not feeling the Christmas spirit. His newest book is an utter flop, the
        critics have turned against him, relatives near and far hound him for money. While his wife plans a lavish
        holiday party for their ever-expanding family and circle of friends, Dickens has visions of the poor house. But
        when his publishers try to blackmail him into writing a Christmas book to save them all from financial ruin, he
        refuses. And a serious bout of writer’s block sets in. </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up-right"> Frazzled and filled with self-doubt, Dickens seeks solace in his great palace of
        thinking, the city of London itself. On one of his long night walks, in a once-beloved square, he meets the
        mysterious Eleanor Lovejoy, who might be just the muse he needs. As Dickens’ deadlines close in, Eleanor propels
        him on a Scrooge-like journey that tests everything he believes about generosity, friendship, ambition, and
        love. The story he writes will change Christmas forever.</p>

        the cold-reading skills she’s honed as a tarot card reader might help her claim the money.</p>

        that there is something very, very wrong about this strange situation and the inheritance at the center of it.
